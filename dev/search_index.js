They are all considered as generic numbers. Whole numbers are loaded as Int64 and real numbers Float64. It is not possible to store the number 1.0 as a real number.\nThe order of keys in a JSON document is undefined. It is therefore not possible to have a consistent ordering of the attributes or variables.\nThe JSON standard does not allow the values NaN, +Inf, -Inf which is problematic for attributes (zarr-python #412,   zarr-specs #81). However, there is a special case for the fill-value to handle NaN, +Inf and -Inf.\nAll dimensions must be associated to Zarr variables.","category":"section"},{"location":"#ZarrDatasets.ZarrDataset","page":"Home","title":"ZarrDatasets.ZarrDataset","text":"ds = ZarrDataset(url::AbstractString,mode = \"r\";\n                 _omitcode = [404,403],\n                 maskingvalue = missing)\nZarrDataset(zg::Zarr.ZGroup; _omitcode, maskingvalue)\nZarrDataset(f::Function,url::AbstractString,mode = \"r\";\n                 maskingvalue = missing)\n\nOpen the zarr dataset at the url or path url.
